# Calendaring and Scheduling Glossary of Terms

This page is an effort to compile, in one location, a common set of terminology with respect to calendaring and scheduling applications and standards. The document incorporates terminology already existing in calendaring standards such as RFC5545 (Internet Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object Specification (iCalendar)), RFC5546 (iCalendar Transport-Independent Interoperability Protocol (iTIP)), RFC6047 (iCalendar Message-Based Interoperability Protocol (iMIP)), RFC4791 (Calendaring Extensions to WebDAV (CalDAV)), RFC6638 (Scheduling Extensions to CalDAV (CalDAV)), as well as input from members of the Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium (CalConnect).

Some glossary terms may not appear in published standards today. These are common calendaring terms that are included so that everyone refers to components in the same manner.

As new standards evolve, the glossary will serve as a resource for those creating documents so that all the standards share a common set of terms.

Calendaring and scheduling implementers will be able to utilize the glossary to assist them as they read and decipher calendaring standards. Calendaring and scheduling users will be able to use the glossary to help them better understand the terminology deployed by applications written using calendaring standards.

<h5 id="access-control">Access Control</h5>
Access control is a system which enables an authority (e.g., user or resource administrator) to control access to different entities in a calendar system. Typically vendors create Preference/Settings options to instantiate access control. Terminology varies considerably across products but broadly speaking access control is usually broken into two areas, read access and write access. Vendor terminology used for read access includes: 'read', 'reviewer', 'proxy read', 'viewer', 'see all', and 'see only freebusy'. Vendor terminology for write access includes: 'write', 'editor', 'proxy write', 'proxy', 'manager', 'administrator', 'designate', 'read/create/edit', 'make changes', 'manage', and 'edit'. (Cp. Delegate and Designate below.)

<h5 id="access-control-list">Access Control List (ACL)</h5>
A list of access control elements that define access control to a particular calendar system entity. (Reference: RFC3744 for its use in a WebDAV context.)

<h5 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h5>
Information pertaining to access to a resource by the physically disabled. This applies to Location Resources.

<h5 id="admittance-info">Admittance Info</h5>
All information required to gain access to a resource. It applies to Location Resources.

<h5 id="agenda">Agenda</h5>
See [Calendar](#calendar).

<h5 id="alarm">Alarm</h5>
Use of the terms alarm, reminder, alert, and notifications vary by implementation and can represent several things. They can represent a setting applied to an event by which a user indicates they want a 'notification' to be triggered to 'remind' them about some event or action (cp. VALARM in RFC5545). They can also be used to designate the type of 'alert' that serves as the notification (e.g., email message, audible sound, pop-up window). (Reference [RFC4791 (CalDAV)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4791), [RFC5545](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545#section-3.6.6), [RFC5546 (iTip)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5546).)

This property in iCalendar can contain multiple attributes specifying additional information, i.e., role, participation status, group membership, delegation, etc. (Reference: [RFC5545](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545#section-3.6.4.1).)

<h5 id="autoconfiguration">Autoconfiguration</h5>
the process of configuring clients such as mobile devices or desktop applications to access a service, or class of service, with a minimum of input from the user of the device. See also Autodiscovery.

<h5 id="autodiscovery">Autodiscovery</h5>
The process used to determine the services provided by a host, or for a domain, including retrieval of the recommended configuration values for those services. The autodiscovery funtionality requires the service provider to declare in a standard way which services are available and what their configuration looks like for the requesting user. See also Autoconfiguration. (Reference: draft-daboo-aggregated-service-discovery.)

Defined by two specifications, the first, RFC4791, specifies a calendar access protocol that allows Calendar User Agents to access and manage calendar data. The second specification, RFC 6638, specifies a standard way of performing scheduling transactions with iCalendar-based calendar components. This document defines the "calendar-auto-schedule" feature of CalDAV. (Reference: RFC4791, and RFC 6638.)

<h5 id="calendar-system">Calendar System</h5>
A way to represent dates as a combination of eras, years, months, weeks, and days in formats used in many different parts of the world. A calendar system also defines the limits for those different quantities and how "date arithmetic" can be done to implement repeating dates. (See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar for a description of many different calendar systems.)

<h5 id="calconnect">CalConnect</h5>
The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium is a non-for-profit partnership between vendors of calendaring and scheduling systems and tools, and users of those tools. Our purpose is to improve all aspects of calendaring and scheduling, in particular interoperability. We do this by improving existing standards, developing new standards, offering interoperability testing for calendaring and scheduling systems and tools, collaborating with other organizations with similar goals, and conducting periodic conferences where engineers and customers meet and interact in a collegial atmosphere. Although CalConnect is not a standards development organization, virtually every important calendaring or calendaring-related standard over the last five years has been authored, edited and/or coedited by members of a CalConnect Technical Committee.

<h5 id="property">Property</h5>
RFCs define the objects and components of their subject which in turn have properties which have values (sometimes referred to as 'property parameters' or 'property attributes'). These "property parameters" contain meta-information about the property or the property value. Property parameters are provided to specify such information as the location of an alternate text representation for a property value, the language of a text property value, the value type of the property value, and other attributes. Throughout this glossary are references to component, property, and attribute following this usage. (Reference: [RFC5545](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545#section-3.8).)

RFC4791), a query between a client and a server that results in object creation, modification, or deletion (cp. RFC4791 and RFC5545), and it is the name of a method in iTIP that makes "an explicit invitation to one or more attendees" (among other things, cp. RFC5546). (Reference: RFC4791, [RFC5545](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545#section-3.7.2), RFC5546, and Internet Calendar Scheduling Protocol (iSchedule).)

<h5 id="reminder">Reminder</h5>
See Alarm.

<h5 id="repeating">Repeating</h5>
See Recurring.

A resource in the scheduling context is any shared entity, that can be scheduled by a calendar user, but does not control its own attendance status. Resources can be of "Location", "Equipment", or "Role" type.

<h5 id="resource-kind">Resource Kind</h5>
Specifies the kind of resource object represented. Some of the possible values are "Location", "Thing", or "Group". Location is used for any physical location resource such as room, building, etc. Thing is used for any physical object that can scheduled like projector, printer, etc. Group is used to specify a group of resources with a specific skill set. For example: drivers, electricians, etc.

<h5 id="resource-manager-info">Resource Manager Info</h5>

<h5 id="subscribed-calendar">Subscribed Calendar</h5>
A calendar that has been published, typically on an HTTP server. See Publish.

<h5 id="task">Task</h5>

<h5 id="text-calendar">Text/calendar</h5>
The MIME content type for encoding iCalendar objects. Example usage includes: email, web pages.

<h5 id="timezone">Timezone also Time Zone</h5>
Areas of the Earth that have adopted the same local time. Time zones are generally centered on meridians of a longitude, that is a multiple of 15, thus making neighboring time zones one hour apart. However, the one hour separation is not universal and the shapes of time zones can be quite irregular because they usually follow the boundaries of states, countries or other administrative areas. In RFC5545, time zones are represented using "VTIMEZONE" calendar components, each with a Time Zone Identifier (TZID) that can be used to tie a particular date and time to a specific timezone.

<h5 id="timezone-service">Timezone Service</h5>
A client/server protocol used for distributing Timezone data. The protocol improves the accuracy and speed of distributing timezone data to ensure clients are kept up to date with sometimes rapidly changing definitions. It also allows clients to avoid having a complete database of all timezones - instead they can download timezone data on a case-by-case basis. (Reference draft-douglass-timezone-service.)

<h5 id="transparency">Transparency</h5>
A property of an event that defines whether it will appear free or busy in free/busy time searches.

<h5 id="utc">UTC (Coordinated Universal Time)</h5>
UTC is designated to be at zero longitude. Also known as Zulu Time (NATO/military designation). Formerly GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) although there is a slight difference. UTC is the basis for all local time offsets. Offsets are either positive or negative. An example is UTC-8 (Pacific Standard Time). Some iCalendar examples:

    DTSTART:19970714T133000 ;Local time
    DTSTART:19970714T173000Z ;UTC time
    DTSTART;TZID=US-Eastern:19970714T133000 ;Local time and time zone reference

<h5 id="valarm">VALARM</h5>
A VALARM calendar component is a grouping of component properties that is a reminder or alarm for an event or a to-do. For example, it may be used to define a reminder for a pending event or an overdue to-do. VALARMs will thus be included within VEVENT and VTODO components. VAVAILABILITY - An iCalendar component that is used to describe periods of time for which a calendar user is available for scheduling of events. (Reference: draft-daboo-calendar-availability.)

<h5 id="vcalendar">vCalendar</h5>
A text representation of calendar and scheduling data created by the Versit consortium (also, the vCalendar specification). The RFC5545 iCalendar specification supersedes the work of vCalendar, though VCALENDAR remains as a component type in the RFC5545 iCalendar specification.

<h5 id="vcard">vCard</h5>
An IETF standard for a text representation of contact data. See CardDAV. (Reference: RFC2426 vCard V3.0, RFC6350 vCard V4.0.)

<h5 id="vevent">VEVENT</h5>
A VEVENT calendar component represents a scheduled amount of time on a calendar. For example, it can be an activity; such as a one-hour long, department meeting from 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM, tomorrow. Generally, an event will take up time on an individual calendar. The VEVENT is also the calendar component used to specify an anniversary or daily reminder within a calendar.

<h5 id="vfreebusy">VFREEBUSY</h5>
A grouping of component properties that represents either a request for free or busy time information, a reply to a request for free or busy time information, or a published set of busy time information.

<h5 id="vjournal">VJOURNAL</h5>
A VJOURNAL calendar component is a grouping of component properties that represent one or more descriptive text notes associated with a particular calendar date. The DTSTART property is used to specify the calendar date with which the journal entry is associated. Examples of a journal entry include a daily record of a legislative body or a journal entry of individual telephone contacts for the day or an ordered list of accomplishments for the day. The VJOURNAL calendar component can also be used to associate a document with a calendar date.

<h5 id="vpoll">VPOLL</h5>
A proposed extension to iCalendar. VPOLL is a new component which allows conducting a "poll" via iTIP exchanges to accomplish consensus scheduling for an event or appointment. See Consensus Scheduling. (Reference: draft-york-vpoll.)

<h5 id="vtodo">VTODO</h5>
A VTODO calendar component is a grouping of component properties and possibly VALARM calendar components that represent an action-item or assignment. For example, it can be used to represent an item of work assigned to an individual; such as "turn in travel expense today".

<h5 id="webdav">WebDAV</h5>
Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) is an extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) that facilitates collaboration between users in editing and managing documents and files stored on World Wide Web servers. See CalDAV and CardDAV. (Reference: RF4918.)

<h5 id="webdav-sync">WebDAV Sync</h5>
An extension to Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) that allows efficient synchronization of the contents of a WebDAV collection. (Reference: RFC6578.)

<h5 id="ws-calendar">WS-Calendar</h5>
