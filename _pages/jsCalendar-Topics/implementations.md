# Implementations

This page will list libraries, clients and servers offering support for jsCalendar.

## Java

### Bedework

[Bedework](https://bedework.github.io/) is currently being updated to
support jsCalendar as a content-type for CalDAV.

A library is available - see [bw-jsforj](https://github.com/Bedework/bw-jsforj) at github.

## C

### Cyrus server

[Cyrus](https://www.cyrusimap.org/) server supports jsCalendar as part
of its [JMAP](https://jmap.io/) protocol implementation.

The source code for jsCalendar and iCalendar mapping is open-source
in [jmap\_ical.c](https://github.com/cyrusimap/cyrus-imapd/blob/master/imap/jmap_ical.c)
