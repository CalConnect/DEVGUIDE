# CalDAV - introduction

CalDAV is a calendaring and scheduling client/server protocol designed to allow users to access calendar data on a server, and to schedule meetings with other users on that server or other servers.

The CalDAV Access protocol has been standardized by the IETF and published as [RFC 4791](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4791).

The CalDAV Scheduling protocol has been standardized by the IETF and published as [RFC 6638](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6638).
