# A place holder for describing vpoll (draft-york-vpoll...)s

The currently existing approach to agreeing on meeting times using [iTip] and/or [iMip] have some significant failings. There is no useful bargaining or suggestion mechanism in iTip, only the ability for a potential attendee to accept or refuse or to counter with a time of their own choosing.

Part of the problem is that for many potential attendees, their freebusy is not an accurate representation of their availability. In fact, when trying to schedule conference calls across different organizations, attendees may not be allowed to provide freebusy information or availability as this may reveal something of the organizations internal activities.

A number of studies have shown that large amounts of time are spent trying to come to an agreement - up to and beyond 20 working hours per meeting. Many organizers fall back on other approaches such as phone calls and email to determine a suitable time.

Online services have appeared as a result and these allow participants to vote on a number of alternatives without revealing or using freebusy or availability. When agreement is reached a conventional scheduling message may be sent to the attendees. This approach appears to reach consensus fairly rapidly. Peer pressure may have some bearing on this as all voters are usually able to see the current state of the voting and may adjust their own meeting schedules to make themselves available for a popular choice.

The component and properties defined in this specification provide a standardized structure for this process and allow calendar clients and servers and web based services to interact.

These structures also have uses beyond the relatively simple needs of most meeting organizers. The process of coming to consensus can also be viewed as a bidding process.
