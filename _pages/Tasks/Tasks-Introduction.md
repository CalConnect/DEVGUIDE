# Tasks - Introduction
Tasks are defined in [RFC 5545][rfc5545] which defines the VTODO component. Extensions of particular interest for tasks are  <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-calext-ical-tasks/">IETF Datatracker for Task Extensions to iCalendar</a> and [RFC 9253 Support for iCalendar Relationships][rfc9253]

It is hoped that the extensions will allow the tasks objects to be used for representation of project management data and for process control.
