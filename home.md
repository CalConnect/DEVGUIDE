Welcome to the Calendaring and Scheduling Developer's Guide wiki.

This wiki is a community driven resource for calendaring and scheduling product developers, with the goal of providing tips, in depth guides, code examples, and background on internet calendaring and scheduling technologies.

The primary audience for this document is developers at all levels - from hobbyists, to web sites embedding calendaring data, to full-blown calendaring and scheduling systems, to complex systems wishing to embed a calendaring platform.

The wiki is available for anyone to access. Updates, additions, and corrections are handled by an editorial team at CalConnect. Details on how to contribute to this wiki are described below.

The Table of Contents shows an outline of the various topics that have been identified as key items of interest to the community. Some of these items already have content available, with the others expected to be filled by contributions from the community.
